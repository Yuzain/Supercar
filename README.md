# Supercar
With this verilog project I simulated the famous Supercar's front leds template using Intel/terasIC DE1-SoC board's LEDs, activable keeping board's Button 3 pushed. 
In addition I developed an increaser and a decreaser linked to Button 1 and Button 2. The results of these operations are show on HEX1 (a 7-segment display) and HEX2, in HEX3 there is the sum of the other two. 
Button 0 is for reset.
